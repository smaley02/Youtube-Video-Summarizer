# Youtube-Video-Summarizer

This project utilizes OpenAI's ChatGPT API and a Youtube transcript API to generate summaries of a inputted youtube video!

This was an individual project that was started because of my interest in artificial intelligence. Unfortunately, the ChatGPT API only offers a free trial, so I had to discontinue this project after my trial finished. 

To use this project, simply download the main.py file and install the youtube transcript and ChatGPT APIs using the links below. An account is required to use the ChatGPT API.

After installing the libraries, modify the main file to include your ChatGPT API key and change the video id to whichever video you choose.
